# ❄️Kill My Apps

This app is designed to terminate running apps, enhancing battery life, enhancing performance, and eliminating unwanted app notifications.\

To make the kill function work, [root] permission is necessary. Without it, you can keep using my app, but you have to stop apps manually by touching the target app and selecting "force stop."

## 🪶Features

- Improve battery and performance

- One click and done!

- Excluded List

- Selectable apps loading mode (user/launchable/system)
