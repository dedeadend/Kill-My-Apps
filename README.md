# ❄️ Kill My Apps

This app is designed to terminate running apps to enhance battery life, enhance performance, and eliminate unwanted app activities.

To make the kill function work, [root] permission is necessary. Without it, you can keep using my app, but you have to stop apps manually by touching the target app and selecting "force stop."


## 🪶 Features

- Improve battery life

- Improve single-task performance (like gaming)

- Free up RAM

- Eliminate unwanted app activities

- One click and done!

- Excluded List

- Selectable apps loading mode (user/launchable/system)


## 📌 Known issues

Maybe see the Google Play Protect warning while installing the APK. This warning is shown because my app was recently released. This will fix automatically after a while.
